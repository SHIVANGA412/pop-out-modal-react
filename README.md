How This Project Works

Create Trip Modal → CreateTripModal.tsx is the pop-out modal where users can add trip details.

Tabs Navigation → Inside the modal, tabs like BasicInfoTab.tsx, DetailsTab.tsx, etc., show different sections of the trip form.

UI Components → Reusable UI elements like buttons, headers, and cards are in the ui folder.

Custom Hooks → hooks folder contains functions that help manage state and behavior in React components.

Styling & Theme → Global styles are in styles, and theme-provider.tsx sets up Material UI theme for consistent look.

Assets & Utilities → Images go in public, and helper functions are in lib to support the components.
